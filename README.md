I'm a Physicist / Software Engineer passionate about building software to accelerate scientific advancement.

At Commonwealth Fusion Systems, I am developing the software tools required to simulate and plan for SPARC operations. Some of these tools are being open sourced and you can find them at [cfs-energy](https://github.com/cfs-energy/)

Previously, I worked at @CERN where my main focus was on the development of the LHCb experiment's real-time HPC data processing pipeline, which analyzes 4TB of data / second.
