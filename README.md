Scientific Software Engineer with expertise in optimizing software and building tools to accelerate research.

At Commonwealth Fusion Systems, I am developing the scientific software tools required to simulate and plan for SPARC operations. Some of these tools are being open sourced and you can find them at [cfs-energy](https://github.com/cfs-energy/)

Previously, I worked at [CERN](https://github.com/CERN) where my main focus was on the development of the LHCb experiment's real-time HPC data processing system, usually referred to as the [ trigger system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(particle_physics)). This system is required to process the full data rate of 4TB of data / second.
My work on this system is public, but on CERN's GitLab and since user accounts are deactivated after leaving CERN, these contributions can be hard to find.

Let me highlight a few core projects I worked on.
The below links will show lists of my contributions to the corresponding project.

- The core packages that make up the LHCb trigger system: [LHCb](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/LHCb/-/commits/master?author=Christoph+Hasse), [Rec](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Rec/-/commits/master?author=Christoph%20Hasse), [Moore](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Moore/-/commits/master?author=Christoph%20Hasse)

- The core [Gaudi](https://gitlab.cern.ch/gaudi/Gaudi/-/commits/master?author=Christoph%20Hasse) framwork used by the ATLAS and LHCb experiement to implement their trigger system
